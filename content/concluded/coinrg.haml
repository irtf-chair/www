%p
  The COIN research group (COINRG) will explore existing research and
  foster investigation of “Compute In the Network” and the resulting
  impacts of programmability in the data plane. The goal is to investigate
  how to harness and to benefit from this emerging disruption to the
  Internet architecture to improve network and application performance as
  well as user experience. COIN will both review existing work as well as
  to encourage research solutions that comprehend the re-imagining of the
  network to be a place where routing, compute, and storage blend.

%p
  COIN will address the ongoing shift from data center (DC) toward edge
  computing and will debate whether this shift can be viewed as a
  cloud-edge continuum. COIN specifically will focus on the evolution
  necessary for networking to move beyond packet interception as the basis
  of network operation and into computation. WCOIN also wants to move
  beyond rudimentary languages for programming switches into the richer
  programmability that is required to support emerging workloads, such as
  edge network analytics, machine learning and deep learn. Such
  applications not only need access to more general-purpose languages, but
  also need to operate in conjunction with local and remote caches,
  computing resources, dynamic control points, and data stewardship.

%p
  Orchestration of end-to-end resources between the DC network and the edge
  is another key topic to address in COIN. In particular, the RG will
  examine orchestration with increasingly heterogeneous distributed
  components and draw inspiration from current approaches (e.g.,
  Kubernetes, Swarm) that are likely to need updating, extending, and/or
  simplifying in multi-domain network environments.

%p
  Use-case-driven requirements, gathered from next-generation applications
  and services (e.g., video streaming, immersive AR/VR,
  autonomous/connected vehicles, industrial IoT), may lead to new
  architectures, which employ novel ways to perform functional distribution
  and leverage co-design of layered approaches.

%p
  COIN will pay close attention to work in DINRG and ICNRG in particular,
  and will work carefully to keep a focused scope despite the breadth of
  initial discussions.

%p
  COIN will interact closely with the IETF transport area to avoid
  proposals that would increase the friction between the end-to-end privacy
  and security of new transport protocols and the need for in-network
  computations. The SPUD efforts in the IETF already addressed some of
  these challenges and COIN intends to continue the dialog around evolving
  end-to-end semantics of IETF transports protocols.  The RG will be aware
  that targeting the space of multi-party computations may impact or be
  impacted by crypto/security properties. COIN will foster discussion on
  what could (or could not) be exposed across network layers, including
  parameters that might enable QoS/QoE, orchestration dynamics, and
  seamless mobility.

%p
  In order to achieve its goals, COIN will expose and advance research on
  distributed, decentralized networks and resources required by DC, edge
  and ambient computing. COIN will investigate the implications of
  increased heterogeneity and limitations that arise if/when DC and edge
  computing employ a common architecture, programmable networks and API and
  interchangeable functionality in the Internet. An assumption will be that
  to improve Internet performance, the network, compute and storage
  resources must work jointly in close partnership throughout the network,
  while servicing data-intensive distributed applications.

%h2 SCOPE

%ol
  %li
    Research on solutions to use programmable network devices,
    languages and abstractions to implement network functions for improved
    Internet performance.

  %li
    Research on use case driven requirements analysis: the cloud continuum
    from the data center to edge networks and beyond including in-network
    computing using programmable switches. Identify potential benefits to
    these networks from in-network functionality, including but not limited
    to compute, cache, manage, control, etc.

  %li
    Research on novel architectures, data-plane abstractions and new
    network protocol designs to efficiently federate decentralized
    computing resources, across the infrastructure regardless of where in
    the network the compute is placed (the DC, the core, the edge, and even
    in the end-user devices).

  %li
    Research on potential new transport protocol, new privacy and security
    mechanisms required or enabled by in-network compute.
