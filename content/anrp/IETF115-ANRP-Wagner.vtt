Hello everyone, my name is Daniel Wagner and I am

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.280
one of the authors of the paper titled

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.280
"United We Stand - Collaborative Detection and

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.840
Mitigation of Amplification DDoS Attacks at Scale".

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.210
DDoS attacks are a type of networking attack that

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.480
can cause service downtime of anything that is

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.020
hosted online, for example financial services or

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.200
the health sector and so forth. The press

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.630
keeps reporting about ever-growing amplification

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.000
DDoS attacks, so they still pose a serious threat

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.040
to the internet. An attacker sends requests

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.080
towards a set of globally distributed machines,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.670
which will then in turn generate responses much

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.440
larger than the initial request. By spoofing the

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.050
source IP address field of the request, the

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.800
attacker can steer the reflectors responses

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.310
towards any target at will. Traditionally, in

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.360
order to mitigate such attacks, a local

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.460
scrubbing service is deployed close to the target,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.400
where they have the consolidated and

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.980
sophisticated view about the ongoing attack and

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.440
drop all the traffic. But the traffic needs to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.500
travel there and pollutes with unwanted packets

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.920
the infrastructures in between. So we propose

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.690
to drop the traffic early in the core of the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.160
internet, where infrastructures like the IXPs

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.370
are located, in order to make them have the

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.560
global view some kind of collaboration is

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.120
necessary in

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.550
between of them. In order to underline the

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.400
beneficial position of the IXPs, we partnered

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.620
with 11 IXPs and assessed the difference the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.880
distance between the reflectors origin and the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.160
IXP. We found that more than 40% of the attack

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.280
traffic is actually originated by a direct IXP

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.470
member, strongly underlining that they have a

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.920
beneficial position within the internet topology.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.690
We further conducted other measurements in order

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.680
to quantify the origin distribution, we quantified

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.450
the collaboration benefit for the individual IXPs,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.640
we put emphasis on the IXPs critical role

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.970
for DDoS mitigation just by the plain position in

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.000
the internet topology. And we also in order to

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.820
enable the collaboration proposed a platform for

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.760
exchanging information about ongoing DDoS attacks

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.820
and evaluated their effectiveness. If you're

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.000
further interested in the paper, you're happily

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.480
invited to read it or attend the full talk.
