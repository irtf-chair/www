        %h2 About the ANRP
        %p
          The Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) is awarded to recognise
          the best recent results in applied networking, interesting new
          research ideas of potential relevance to the Internet standards
          community, and upcoming people that are likely to have an impact on
          Internet standards and technologies, with a particular focus on cases
          where these people or ideas would not otherwise get much exposure or
          be able to participate in the discussion.

        %p
          We encourage nominations of researchers with relevant research results,
          interesting ideas, and new perspectives.  The award will offer them
          the opportunity to present and discuss their work with the engineers,
          network operators, policy makers, and scientists that participate in
          the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its research arm, the
          Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).  Both self- and third-party
          nominations for this prize are encouraged.

        %p
          The Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) consists of:
        %ul
          %li
            a cash prize of $1000 (USD)
          %li
            an invited talk at the IRTF Open Meeting
          %li
            a travel grant to attend a week-long IETF meeting (airfare, hotel, registration, stipend)
          %li
            recognition at the IETF plenary
          %li
            an invitation to related social activities

        %p
          In addition, prize winners may be offered additional travel grants to
          attend future IETF and/or IRTF meetings. Such grants are made at the
          discretion of the award committee, based on community feedback,
          engagement with the community, and potential future impact.

        %p
          Applied Networking Research Prize awards are made once per calendar
          year with a nomination deadline in late November.  Each year, several
          winners will be chosen and invited to present their work at one of
          the three IETF meetings during the following year.


      %div.tab-pane.container.fade#nominate
        %h2 How to Nominate

        %p
          Nominations are for a 
          %em single
          author of an original, peer-reviewed, journal, conference or workshop
          paper that was recently published or accepted for publication.
          The nominee
          %em must
          be one of the main authors of the nominated paper. Both
          self-nominations (nominating one's own paper) and third-party
          nominations (nominating someone else's paper, with their permission) are encouraged.

        %p
          The nominated paper should provide a scientific foundation for
          possible future engineering work in the IETF, or research and
          experimentation in the IRTF. It should analyze the behavior of
          Internet protocols in operational deployments or realistic testbeds,
          make an important contribution to the understanding of Internet
          scalability, performance, reliability, security or capability, or
          otherwise be of relevance to ongoing or future IETF or IRTF
          activities.

        %p
          Nominations
          %em must
          briefly describe how the nominated paper relates to these goals.
          They should describe how involving the nominee in the IETF and IRTF
          process, and bringing them to an IETF meeting, would help to foster
          the transition of the results and/or ideas into new IETF engineering
          work or IRTF experimentation, or otherwise seed new activities that
          will have an impact on the real-world Internet.

        %p
          The goal of the Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) is to foster
          the transitioning of research results into real-world benefits for
          the Internet. Therefore, applicants must indicate that they (or the
          nominee, in case of third-party nominations) are available to attend
          at least one of the IETF meetings in the following year.
          In-person attendance is desirable, where possible, but due to the
          impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remote participation options will
          be available for ANRP prize winners at all IETF meetings in 2024.

        %p
          Nominations are submitted via the
          %a{ :href => "https://anrp2024.hotcrp.com/"} submission site
          and must include:
        %ul
          %li
            the name and email address of the nominee;
          %li
            a bibliographic reference to the published (or accepted) nominated
            paper;
          %li
            a PDF copy of the nominated paper;
          %li
            a statement that describes how the
            %em nominated paper
            fulfills the goals of the award and how the
            %em nominee
            would engage with the IETF and/or IRTF community;
          %li
            a statement of the nominees availability to present
            their work at the IETF meetings in the award year;
          %li
            a statement that the nominee accepts that the IRTF 
            %a{ :href => "/policies/ipr"} Intellectual Property Rights disclosure rules
            will apply to their award talk at the IRTF open meeting;
          %li
            a brief biography or CV for the nominee; and 
          %li
            optionally, any other supporting information (link to nominee's web
            site, etc.)

        %p All nominees will be notified by email about the decision regarding their nomination.

        %p
          Papers nominated for the Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) are
          %em not
          considered to be contributions to the IETF or IRTF. However, the
          invited talks about those papers given at the IRTF Open Meeting
          %em are
          considered to be contributions and 
          %a{ :href => "/policies/ipr"} the IRTF Intellectual Property Rights disclosure rules
          apply.
