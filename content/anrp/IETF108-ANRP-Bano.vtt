00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.400
Hello everyone, I am Bano and I am excited to

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.300
present our work Scanning the Internet

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.580
for Liveness, which was carried out in

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.580
collaboration with Philip, Mupin, Srikant, Zakir,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.420
Stephen,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.560
Richard and Wern.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.100
Internet scanning is a key technique to measure

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.060
the Internet at scale, and it has diverse

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.670
applications such as address-based utilization,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.680
host reachability, topology, service availability,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.140
security vulnerabilities, and application layer

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.360
discrimination.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.490
The key concept of IPLiveness is to check whether

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.640
a target IP address responds to a

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.400
probe packet.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.550
Now this seems pretty straightforward, but

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.100
actually it's not.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.520
There are a few questions for which we don't have

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.420
a good answer.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.130
For example, what type of probe packets should we

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.460
send if we want to maximize the responding

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.660
host population?

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.480
What type of responses can we expect and which

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.780
factors determine such responses?

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.550
What degree of consistency can we expect when

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.740
probing the same host with different probe

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.260
packets?

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.320
What we are essentially missing here is a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.020
systematic framework that allows us to understand

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.740
IPLiveness and how it manifests in the form of

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.420
host replies to active probing.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.780
Now this depends on multiple factors, such as how

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.900
the scan was conducted, how different

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.770
protocols interact, filtering policies near the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.940
target IP address, and temporal patterns

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.740
in IP responsiveness.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.750
Our work makes three key contributions to fill

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.580
this gap.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.500
The first is a taxonomy of liveness.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.100
The second is a methodology for systematically

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.900
inferring IPLiveness by performing Internet-wide

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.220
scans concurrently across a set of different

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.380
protocols at various layers, i.e. ICMP, TCP,

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.420
and UDP.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.650
And then we perform an analysis of gathered data

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.340
to present an in-depth view of liveness.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.350
So in the rest of this presentation, we will dive

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.180
deeper into each of these contributions.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.300
We will begin with the taxonomy, focusing on each

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.580
layer at a time.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.660
So we begin with the network layer.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.630
When we send a probe packet, we first check if

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.360
there is a reply.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.970
If there is no reply, then we say that the target

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.100
IP address is dark at the network layer.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.700
So in this example, IP1 is dark at the network

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.960
layer because it does not send any response

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:16.940
to our TCP SYN on port 80.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.490
If there is a reply, then we check what is the IP

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.260
address from which the reply came.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.510
If the reply came from a different IP address

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.620
than the one that we probed, then we flag

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.970
the responding IP address as network layer alive

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.380
and we label the target IP address as

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.580
dark at the network layer.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.940
So in this example, we send TCP SYN on port 80 to

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.540
IP1, but we receive an ICMP error from

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.060
some other IP address, IP2, which we label as

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.260
network layer alive, but the original target

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.160
IP address that was probed, because it did not

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.620
respond, we label it as network layer

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:11.020
dark.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.550
And if we do receive a reply from the probed IP

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.820
address, then we say that it is alive at

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:24.740
the network layer.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.790
So moving on to the transport layer, which is

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.460
only relevant to TCP because as we know

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.050
UDP is one short communication protocol where the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.020
application layer payload is part of the

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.480
original probe and there's no transport layer as

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.020
such.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.260
So for TCP, we check if there is a TCP reply, if

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.940
the reply is a TCP reset, we say that the

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:55.800
target IP address is active at the transport

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.340
layer.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.160
If the response is a TCP SYNAC, we say that the

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.940
target IP address is alive at the transport

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.180
layer.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.500
Moving on to the application layer, which applies

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.980
to both TCP and UDP, we check if there

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.460
is an application layer reply.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.270
If there is one, then we say that the target IP

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.660
address is active at the application layer.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.370
Next we check if the reply is well formed in the

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.900
sense that it complies with the expected

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.340
syntax of the protocol that was scanned.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.140
And if it does, then we say that the target IP

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.140
address is alive at the application layer.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.300
So this was the taxonomy.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.470
Next we shift our focus to the methodology that

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.980
we use to perform our scans.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.140
We carried out eight concurrent scans, one ICMP

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.260
echo scan, five TCP SYN scans on ports

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:13.500
corresponding to SSH, Telnet, HTTP, HTTPS, and CWMP.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.600
And this choice was made on the basis of

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.310
selecting protocols that represent at least

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.260
partially

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.560
service level protocols as well as client-side

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.220
protocols.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.860
And then we also scanned to UDP-based

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.740
applications, that is DNS and NTP.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.990
All of our scans were conducted using ZMap and we

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.940
performed the data analysis using Cilk.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.280
We employed a few considerations to ensure the

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.540
soundness of our measurements.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.030
The first one of which relates to temporal churn

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.820
due to IP addresses legitimately coming

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.180
online and offline or because of dynamic IP

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.300
assignment practices.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.320
So to mitigate the effects of temporal churn, we

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.140
carried out scans for all the eight protocols

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:15.330
that were mentioned on the previous slide

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.380
simultaneously.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.900
Next to ensure that we capture a comprehensive

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.740
view of liveness, we recorded negative responses

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:32.260
in addition to positive responses.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.700
And finally, because we carried out eight

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.380
concurrent scans on shared hardware, the

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.020
probability

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.220
of packet loss is high, especially close to the

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.740
host and also due to transient network

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.740
issues.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.700
So to account for that, we sent redundant probes.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.800
However, because network losses usually take

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.700
place in bursts, we used an approach which

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.110
we call delayed retransmissions, which means that

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.700
instead of sending the original probe

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.010
and the retransmission to a target IP address

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.340
back to back, we instead scanned an entire

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.380
block.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.020
So in this example, we have IP block one.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.930
And once we finished with that block, say in 30

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.380
minutes, then we sent retransmissions

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.240
to the same block before moving on to the next

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.580
block, which is IP block two in this

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.060
example.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.880
And then we sent retransmissions to IP block two

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.200
and so forth.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.590
So we did a block by block scanning, sending

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:37.020
original probes to a block followed by retransmissions

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.660
and so forth.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.360
So in summary, we carried out eight concurrent

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.180
scans, which finished in about 24 hours,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:47.300
generating

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.300
about 2.3 terabytes of data.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.120
And overall, our scans recorded 487 million

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.620
network alive IP addresses out of the 3.6

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.360
billion IP addresses that were probed, which we

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.820
call IP all.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.890
In the remaining slides, I will present main

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:13.660
results from our study in the context of IP

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.340
all.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.550
So finally, presenting the interesting part of

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.300
this presentation, that is key results

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:28.780
from characterization of IP liveness.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.380
Let's start with the network layer.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.970
So the first question we ask is that what is the

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.200
coverage of different probe types?

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.680
So here's the breakdown of IP all covered by

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.260
different probe types, that is ICMP, TCP

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.940
scans, UDP scans, and then union corresponds to

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.700
the union of these three probe types.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.780
We find that ICMP echo probes are most effective

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:00.980
in discovering network active IP addresses,

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:08.820
capturing 79% of IP all, followed by TCP probes.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.250
But interestingly, 16% of IP all can only

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.540
exclusively be discovered through TCP, and

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.290
2% can only be discovered through UDP probes,

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.540
which implies that studies that infer liveness

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:27.170
only by means of ICMP probes will miss out on

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:31.500
about 16% of IP all, which can only be

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:40.180
viewed through TCP and UDP.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.000
Here is the same graph, except instead of looking

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.820
at it through the lens of individual

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.970
IP addresses, we look at it at the granularity of

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.700
/24 blocks.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.310
And as we can see, the variation in liveness

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.140
viewed through different probe types is much

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.340
less pronounced.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.100
But overall, TCP scans show the highest coverage

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.340
discovering about 5 million active /24 blocks,

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:17.980
about 3% more than ICMP echo.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.810
Next we look at the coverage of different probe

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.220
responses.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.540
So here we break down our previous graph by

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.460
response type.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.170
So here is ICMP scan, and here is the coverage

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.060
that we get when we capture different response

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.060
types.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.640
So here is echo reply, ICMP error, both, and here

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.260
TCP reply, ICMP error, and both,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:46.860
and for UDP, UDP reply, ICMP error, and both.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.150
We find that 2.3% of IP all are discoverable only

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.140
through ICMP error responses, which means

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.710
that studies that infer IP liveness through only

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:01.180
successful responses will miss 2.3% of

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:09.030
IP all if they do not capture error responses or

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:13.140
negative responses.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.830
Next we look at key results from our

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:21.810
characterization of IP liveness by transport

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:22.980
layer.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.170
We ask how does the probed port affect the

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.420
responsive population.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.020
Now this wouldn't be a relevant question if an IP

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.860
address responded to all ports consistently,

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:40.300
but we found that's not the case.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.350
Only 24% of active hosts respond to probe packets

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.420
on all 5 ports, which highlights the

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.550
potential effect of firewalling or filtering

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:54.460
practices on IP liveness as viewed through

00:12:54.460 --> 00:13:04.380
different probes on different ports.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:09.420
Next we look at what is the coverage by probe

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.140
response type.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.830
And we find that 11.5% of all TCP activity can

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.300
exclusively be found through CWMP.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:26.810
In comparison, SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS provide

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:33.580
unique coverage of 3-6% of active IPs.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:41.580
Now finally let's take a look at a cross-protocol

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.840
view of IP liveness.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:50.060
So this map shows that given that IP is alive or

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:54.700
active for a protocol along the X-axis,

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.490
what is the likelihood that it would also be

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:00.180
alive or active for a protocol along the

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.560
Y-axis?

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.710
So for example, if we focus on this box, what

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:12.160
this means is that if or given that an IP

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:18.970
is active for SSH, the probability that it is

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:24.660
also active for HTTP is 0.68.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.070
So some of the highlights from this map are that

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.440
a significant fraction of transport active

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.560
hosts, that is 26% on average for TCP services,

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.440
and 12% for UDP cannot be discovered through

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.040
ICMP.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.360
Another observation is that if a given host is

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.960
active for 10-net, then with high probability

00:14:51.960 --> 00:15:01.560
it is active for SSH and HTTPS.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.270
And for CWMP, only 56% of active hosts respond to

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.980
HTTP probes, indicating an underlying filtering

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:17.200
pattern of the CWMP active population.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.320
So to conclude, this work presented a methodology

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.240
to capture a comprehensive and minimally noisy

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:31.040
picture of the state of Internet liveness.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.220
And this taxonomy can serve as a basis for

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.640
designing and executing future measurement

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.160
studies when it comes to decisions such as what

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.960
type of probe packets should be employed,

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.250
what type of responses should be captured, how

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.880
those responses should be interpreted,

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.650
and whether it is appropriate to use the output

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:59.720
of one scan as input for subsequent measurements.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.330
On that note, I conclude, and I look forward to

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:03.280
your questions.
