00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.360
Hi everyone, I'm Sangeetha Abdu-Jyothi. I'm an

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.240
assistant professor at the University of

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.960
California, Irvine and an affiliated researcher

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.840
at VMware Research. Today I'll be presenting

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.320
my work on understanding the impact of a cosmic

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.680
phenomenon that is capable of taking down

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.980
the internet, which is solar super storms. What

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.400
are the impacts of losing internet connectivity?

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.960
We know that it can affect our professional and

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.360
social lives significantly, especially

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.930
now during the pandemic. For large businesses,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.840
the impact can be devastating. The revenue

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.060
loss per hour for some of the large companies are

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.720
estimated to be tens of millions of dollars.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.690
And at the scale of countries, it can be hundreds

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.400
of millions per hour or in billions per day.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.310
And it's not just the economic impact. Many of

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.760
the other critical infrastructure, such

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.670
as healthcare, that depend on the internet will

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.040
be severely affected as well. Now, what

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.690
if we have an internet outage lasting weeks or

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.880
months and spanning large areas across

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.080
the globe? One might think that such a global outage

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.240
is never going to happen because the

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.600
internet is a resilient distributed system, which

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.800
successfully withstood several natural

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.050
disasters and man-made attacks in the past.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.960
Unfortunately, this is a worst case scenario

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.130
that could happen in our lifetime. The next once

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.200
in a hundred year disaster after this

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.860
pandemic could be a solar super storm that is

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.400
capable of taking down large parts of the

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.350
internet. Today, network researchers and

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.820
operators overlook this threat while building our

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.600
infrastructure.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.170
In this talk, I present a deeper view of this

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.720
natural disaster and its impact on various

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.970
internet infrastructure components. There are two

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.720
types of solar events that are popularly

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.540
known as solar storms, solar flares and coronal

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.200
mass ejections or CMEs. Their impact on global

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.170
infrastructure varies widely. So solar flares

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.000
involve large amounts of emitted energy as

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.390
electromagnetic radiation. These are essentially

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.200
flashes of light and they reach the earth

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.610
in just eight minutes based on the speed of light.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.920
Fortunately, they mostly affect only

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.910
the upper layers of the atmosphere and do not

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.920
cause any damages to terrestrial infrastructure,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.120
but they do affect satellite communication. Coronal

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.720
mass ejections or CMEs involve the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.890
emission of electrically charged solar matter and

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.840
the accompanying magnetic field into space.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.420
And once these are emitted from the sun, they can

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.840
take anywhere from 13 hours to five days

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.400
to reach the earth based on their speed. And

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.240
these CMEs are capable of causing significant

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.980
damages to terrestrial infrastructure. Now CMEs

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.040
are the focus of this talk and we'll

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.620
discuss the impact more closely soon. Both solar

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.360
flares and CMEs originate near sunspots,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.640
which are temporary dark spots on the sun caused

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.160
by concentration of magnetic field

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.400
flux. And when the number of sunspots increases,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.160
there is a higher probability of both solar

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.140
flares and CMEs occurring. Now how do CMEs affect

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.360
us? The magnetized emissions of coronal

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.210
mass ejections are highly directional. And when

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.560
the earth is in the direct path of a

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.070
CME, it interacts with the earth's magnetic field

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.880
and large electric fields are produced

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.970
on the earth's surface through electromagnetic

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.360
induction. And this induced electric field

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.780
can cause geomagnetically induced currents to

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.600
flow through long cables like internet

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.630
cables or power transmission lines that have

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.400
ground connections that are located far apart

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.990
on the earth's crust. And these currents can

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.960
cause significant damages to these long distance

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.600
cables. And we know that cable repair, especially

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.310
in the ocean on submarine cables is very

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.080
expensive

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.730
and time consuming. Now what are some of the

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.800
characteristics of these induced currents?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.260
So here due to the orientation of the earth's

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.760
magnetic field, higher latitudes are at a

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.490
significantly higher risk. This is because the

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.920
earth's magnetic poles are located closer

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.430
to the geographic poles as well. And it's for the

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.320
same reason that auroras are common

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.320
closer to the poles than the equator. Now since

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.760
the impact is caused by interaction

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.900
with the earth's magnetic field, the induced

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.880
currents can affect wide areas and they're

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.840
not restricted to the portion of the earth that

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.800
is facing the sun. And geomagnetically

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.080
induced currents are only induced in cables with

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.800
ground connections that are separated

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.870
by large distances and have an electrical

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.360
conductor that runs across that distance.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.310
Another interesting thing is that conductors

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.120
along different orientations on earth are

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.750
at equal risk. In other words, the north, south

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.840
or east, west orientation of the cable

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.000
does not influence the induced current. The

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.600
induced electric fields can be in any direction.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.530
Now the most important question is when will a

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.480
large event that actually affects us happen

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.480
next? Solar events are extremely hard to predict,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.840
just like earthquakes or any other natural

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.350
disasters. And small scale solar storms happen

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.720
all the time. What we are more interested

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.500
in are solar super storms that can have a

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.680
significant impact on our lives. The largest

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.790
solar events on record occurred in 1859 and 1921,

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.160
long before the advent of modern technology

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.440
and the modern internet. The 1859 event in

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.960
particular is popularly known as the Carrington

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.970
event. And both these events triggered extensive

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.600
power outages across the globe and also caused

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.300
significant damages to the communication network

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.400
of that time, which was the telegraph network.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.350
A Carrington scale event missed the earth by just

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.640
one week back in 2012. And the estimates

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.720
for probability of occurrence of such extreme

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.840
space weather, like the Carrington event of

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.400
the 1921 event, that directly impact the earth,

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.560
ranges from 1.6% to 12% per decade. But that's

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.040
not all. The risk is not uniform because the

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.480
solar activity goes through cycles. So here

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.020
we have the variation in the number of sunspots

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.440
across years. And so on the y-axis, we have

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.450
the number of sunspots and we have different

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.680
years from 1700 to 2020. And here we can see

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.970
that solar activity waxes and wanes in cycles of

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.320
period length approximately 11 years. And

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.050
during solar maxima, there's an increase in the

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.400
frequency of CMEs. In addition to the

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.750
11 year cycle, the solar activity also goes

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.920
through a longer term cycle of approximately

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.860
80 to 100 years. And this is called Gleisberg

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.960
cycle. And the peak solar activity, the peak

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.680
across these different solar cycles can vary

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.760
across the 100 year period. And this causes

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.420
the frequency of CMEs to vary by a factor of four

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.280
across the strongest and the weakest

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.040
cycles in a 100 year cycle. Now, if we look

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.800
closely at this plot, we can see that the

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.020
last three decades, where modern technological

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.160
advancement happened, and most of the internet

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.890
infrastructure was laid down, coincided with the

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.120
period of weak solar activity. In the

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.100
last three decades. Now we are at the beginning

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.480
of solar cycle 25, and the sun is expected

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.930
to become more active in the near future. And due

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.880
to the absence of extreme activity

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.240
in the recent past, we have overlooked the impact

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.760
of these events on the internet infrastructure.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.470
So the bottom line here is that a large event

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.560
could happen sometime during our lifetime.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.810
And the impact is big enough that we should

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.560
prepare our infrastructure for it. Now, the

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.300
next interesting question is how are various

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.720
internet components affected? So let's start

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.340
with wired infrastructure. Localized

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.890
infrastructure such as data centers can be

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:33.920
protected from

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.970
voltage surges caused by these CMEs using

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.240
transient voltage surge suppressors. And they

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.550
are relatively inexpensive. So if your

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.630
infrastructure is localized in some area, then it

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:48.160
can be

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.120
relatively easily protected. Long distance cables

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.280
constitute the most vulnerable components

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.480
in the internet infrastructure. So as we all know,

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.600
today's long distance LAN and sub mini

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.640
cables carry signals in optical fibers. And the

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.880
optical fiber itself is immune to these

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.490
geomagnetically induced currents because they

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.960
carry light and not electricity. But very

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.470
long cables have repeaters at 50 to 150 kilometer

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.040
intervals, which are connected in series and

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.320
powered by a conductor that runs along the length

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.000
of the cable. And this conductor is

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.370
susceptible to damages from induced currents. And

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.280
today, we don't have good failure models

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.550
to model the failure characteristics of long

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.880
cables. But the induced voltage across these

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.400
cables could be several magnitudes higher than

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.320
what the power system associated with

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.280
these cables are designed to handle. And today,

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.360
submarine cables have not been stress tested

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.380
under such large variations. So our long distance

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.880
cables are vulnerable. Internet routers, just

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.740
like data centers, can be protected from direct

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.520
voltage surges using voltage suppressors.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.100
So they are safe. Now moving on to wireless

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.440
infrastructure, satellites at high altitudes

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.810
are directly exposed to these solar storms.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:27.560
Typically, they generally have radiation shielding

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.880
for protection from high energy electrons.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.800
However, very strong storms can cause electrons

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.640
to penetrate deep into the interior regions of a

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.240
satellite and damage its electronic components.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.350
Solar storms can also cause drag on satellites,

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.080
which can lead to satellites losing their

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.090
orbit and re-entering the atmosphere and burning

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.160
up. So very recently, in February 2022, we

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.020
saw the news that 40 Starlink satellites were

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.800
lost to a geomagnetic storm. When a small

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.480
scale storm hit while the satellites were at

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.680
lower altitudes, while they were being

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.110
launched and before they were installed in their

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.400
high altitude orbits. So satellites

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.140
are known to be vulnerable to geomagnetic storms.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.880
Cell towers are located at the ground

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.670
level and are protected from direct exposure by

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.920
the atmosphere. Similarly, personal devices

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.800
such as laptops and mobile phones are also safe.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.680
So to summarize, long distance cables

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.220
and satellites are the most vulnerable components

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.560
of the internet. Other components could suffer

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:48.330
from power outages, but they're not susceptible

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.680
to direct damages. To understand the impact

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.610
on internet infrastructure, I looked at a broad

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.960
set of data sets comprising of various

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.230
internet components. The submarine cable map

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.200
consists of submarine cables across the globe.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.980
The ITU cable map consists of land cable

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.310
information from across the globe collected by

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.880
various

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.720
regional entities. The InterTubes data set

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.480
includes long haul fiber cables in the United

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.290
States. And I also look at publicly available

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.280
internet exchange point location information

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.120
and DNS root server locations. And finally,

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.800
router locations with autonomous system mapping

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.600
obtained from Kaida was also analyzed. So now let's

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.360
look at some of the results. So

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.860
we know that higher latitudes are more vulnerable

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.480
to induced currents, particularly above 40

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.810
degree threshold. So we evaluate the distribution

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:54.200
of infrastructure components in this vulnerable

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.140
latitude region. So here we have the probability

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.040
density function across various latitudes

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.580
plotted on the x-axis. And we look at the

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.720
distribution of population as well as submarine

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.790
cable endpoints. So here we see that the

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.920
population is more concentrated on lower latitudes,

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.080
while

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.750
the infrastructure distribution is concentrated

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.840
at higher latitudes. And this shows that the

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.210
submarine cable endpoints, especially between the

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.840
US and Europe, are highly concentrated

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.680
at higher latitudes, which are more vulnerable.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.880
And next we look at a variety of other internet

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.280
infrastructure components. So here we have again

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.640
the distribution across various latitudes.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.540
On the x-axis, we have a latitude threshold. And

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.480
on the y-axis, we have concentration of

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.800
the infrastructure component above that threshold.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.600
So here we look at internet routers, IXPs,

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.930
DNS root servers, and also the population. So the

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:05.080
most vulnerable region, again, is above

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.830
the 40 degree threshold. So that's towards the

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.560
left of the dotted line at 40. And here

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.740
we see that only about 16% of the world

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.410
population is in this region, but about 35% to 45%

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:19.440
of

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.190
the various internet infrastructure components is

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.200
in this vulnerable region. And this holds

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.190
for other components as well. You can find more

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:31.440
details in my paper. But the key takeaway

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.620
is that the internet infrastructure is skewed

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.840
towards more vulnerable regions when we consider

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:44.280
the threat of solar solar storms. Next, we look

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.440
at the cable length distribution. So

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.960
here on the x-axis, we have cable length in

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.320
kilometers in log scale. And this is a comparison

00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.730
of CDFs of lengths of land cables and submarine

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.640
cables. And here the submarine data set is

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.550
complete. It consists of all existing submarine

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.760
cables that are currently active. The land

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.180
cables obtained from the ITU data set is not

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.920
complete, but it is the largest data set that

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.510
was publicly available. And here, only cables

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.640
that are longer than 150 kilometers needs

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.510
repeaters and hence need the conductor along the

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:30.000
length of the cable, which is vulnerable

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.740
to failures. So here we observe that more than 70%

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.120
of the cables on land don't need

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.290
repeaters and hence are not vulnerable to the

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:45.320
threat of induced currents. But only about

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.490
20% of submarine cables are shorter than this

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.400
threshold. So this means that nearly

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.220
80% of submarine cables need repeaters and hence

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.200
are susceptible to damages from induced

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.560
currents. In short, submarine cables are more

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.600
vulnerable than land cables under this threat.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.570
I also conducted a repeater failure analysis

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:16.480
based on latitude-based failure models. So

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.180
there are several interesting observations. The

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.920
US faces a high risk of losing connectivity

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.820
to Europe during a solar superstorm. This is

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.360
because in the East Coast, most cables

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.830
between the US and Europe are concentrated

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:35.160
between the Northeast of the US and the UK,

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.840
which is most likely done for low latency. And

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.680
there are no connections from Florida

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.420
to Southern Europe, which would be less

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:46.840
vulnerable region. Fortunately, the cables

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.440
between Brazil

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.100
and Europe are less vulnerable. And it was also

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.760
surprising to find that the cable between

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.030
Brazil and Southern Europe is shorter than all

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:00.880
the cables between the US and Europe.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.580
It's also located in the less vulnerable region

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.640
closer to the equator.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.670
Looking at Asia, Singapore has a high chance of

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:13.320
retaining connectivity to neighboring countries,

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.160
even under severe storms. This is because the

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.600
cables are much shorter and also located

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:24.290
at lower latitudes, which are less vulnerable. So

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:25.840
this is the country-level connectivity

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.500
analysis. Next, we look at locations of public

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.000
data

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.330
centers across the globe. Here, red shows a

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.080
higher density, followed by orange, and

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.090
finally blue. We observe that data centers are

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.480
concentrated in vulnerable high-latitude

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.040
regions. And this observation also holds for hyperscale

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.720
providers such as Google, Facebook,

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.830
and Twitter. While these localized infrastructures

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:56.640
won't suffer direct damages, access to these

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:02.720
data centers can be affected. I also looked at

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.240
other internet infrastructure

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.600
components like domain name system. And with DNS,

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.160
root servers are highly distributed and

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.560
hence not vulnerable. And then autonomous systems,

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.280
a large fraction of autonomous systems

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.900
have a presence in vulnerable regions. But the

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:26.480
vast majority of ASS have a small spread.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.850
And in the case of DNS servers, we only looked at

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.400
root servers. Location data of top-level

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.990
domain servers and other authoritative servers

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.080
was not available.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.420
So these are some of the preliminary findings.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.440
And so this work leaves more questions than

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:51.920
answers. So there is a lot of ongoing and future

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.400
work.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.160
So this paper primarily looked at internet

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.000
partitioning based on submarine cables alone.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.740
Now, understanding the impact on end-to-end

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.320
behavior of applications remained an open

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.320
challenge. So this needs to take into account

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.240
both land and submarine cables.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.570
The primary analysis only looked at DNS root

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.800
servers. To understand availability, we need

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.970
to understand the distribution of the entire DNS

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.000
infrastructure, including the top-level

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.530
domain servers and authoritative servers, the

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.760
extent of caching in these servers, and

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:30.110
many other factors. Another interesting question

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.160
is, how will

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.710
AS level connectivity be affected by large-scale

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:40.120
network partitioning? And this needs AS level

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:46.840
connectivity analysis. Next, we need to, so in

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.040
order to robustify

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.910
the internet infrastructure, we need to devise

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.720
solutions for improving long-term resilience

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.190
of the infrastructure. So for example, this could

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:59.960
involve adding new cables in locations

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.070
that are less vulnerable. For example, between

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.720
the US and Europe, do we need a cable that's

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:11.200
further south to ensure resiliency? Another

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.120
interesting direction is design of

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.060
new inter-domain protocols that will improve path

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:20.360
diversity in the wide area network during

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:26.570
a disaster like a solar superstorm. Another very

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:30.920
useful feature of CMEs is that

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:35.260
it will reach the earth only 13 hours to 5 days

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.120
after it originates at the sun. So this

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.620
gives us a short interval to prepare for an

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:44.080
impact. And this is unlike disasters like,

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.240
for example, earthquake, where we have little to

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:52.280
no warning. This CMEs will give us 13 hours

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.500
to 5 days lead time. Now, how can we use this

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.400
lead time effectively?

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.010
We need to develop plans that will allow us to

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.200
prepare for an impact. How should data

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.870
centers react? What should internet services

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.320
service providers do? Do we need to increase

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.690
cache time of DNS entries? How should content

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:14.440
providers distribute data across different

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.820
data centers? If we know, if we have rough

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:21.480
estimates of probability of network partitioning.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.920
And more broadly, we also need to rethink our

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.120
models of failure analysis. Current best

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.020
practices on fault tolerance and resilience

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:34.000
evaluation in software systems rely on failure

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.200
models that consider a limited number of failures.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.720
We need to test our systems under large scale

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.250
failures and understand the behavior of our

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:50.800
protocols under large scale network partitioning.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.420
Next, another interesting future direction is

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.280
related to reconnecting a partitioned internet.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.780
After a solar superstorm, the internet may be

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.360
partitioned due to failures in long distance

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.780
cables or due to power outages in some regions

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.920
that could last days or weeks. So we need

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.800
to prepare with alternative solutions that can

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.920
provide temporary connectivity after impact.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.890
So some examples could be internet connected

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.920
balloons or high altitude platform stations

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.440
that are mobile and typically deployed in the

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.640
stratosphere at heights of about 20 kilometers.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.260
Ideally, they should rely on renewable power

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.680
sources such as solar energy to guarantee

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.870
connectivity even during power outages. So there

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:38.880
is some research in these areas, but

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:44.220
these are avenues that are worth exploring. And

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:48.600
finally, another very important factor

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.050
that we typically overlook today is the interdependence

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:55.280
of the internet with power grids. Now, both

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.030
internet and power grids are designated as

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.400
uniquely critical because all other critical

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.340
sectors rely on them. They are also interdependent

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.440
on each other and both are susceptible to

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.840
failures from solar superstorms. Hence, we need

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.800
to study the joint failure characteristics

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.080
on this complex interdependent system under solar

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.360
storms as well as other large scale

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:26.080
disasters. There are some interesting features

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.480
here because they have very different failure

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:33.050
characteristics. For example, in the US, there

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:36.720
are three regional power grids, the Eastern

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.600
Interconnection, Western Interconnection and the

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.480
Texas Interconnection. Now, if the power

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:46.150
grid in New York fails, it will only affect the

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:49.920
Eastern region and will not cause any

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.380
effects on the power grid in say, California,

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.640
which is on the west. The northeast will be

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.200
without power, but it's not possible to transfer

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.600
electricity from the west to the east because

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.240
these power grids are disconnected. Now, on the

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.680
other hand, if you look at internet connections,

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.970
if all internet connection to the east coast

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:15.000
fails, there'll be significant shifts in BDB

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.650
paths across the globe and potential overload in

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:23.400
network cables on the west coast. So, in

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.440
short, the internet is more global compared to

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.960
power grids and even regional failures

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.220
can result in significant consequences and churn

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:36.680
across the broader internet. So, understanding

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.200
their interdependency is an open question. So,

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.760
these are just a few of the open problems.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.700
There are many, many more. So, with that, I'll

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:51.440
end the talk with a summary. So, space

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.170
weather, particularly coronal mass ejections from

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.720
the sun, poses significant risk to our

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.780
internet infrastructure. And the current

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.540
infrastructure has not been stress tested under

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.280
strong solar

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.670
events because modern technological advancement

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:11.640
coincided with the period of weak solar activity.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.920
So, the complete extent of threat is yet to be

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.000
estimated. This is just the first work

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.970
in that direction. Internet infrastructure

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.400
components are currently skewed towards highly

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.420
vulnerable regions in the higher latitudes. So,

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:32.840
we need to think about improving the overall

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.840
end-to-end resilience. And at a high level, we

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.480
need to work towards better understanding

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.410
and improving the resilience of the global

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.480
internet infrastructure. Thank you. Thanks

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.820
for listening to my talk. And I'll be happy to

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.400
take questions after this.
