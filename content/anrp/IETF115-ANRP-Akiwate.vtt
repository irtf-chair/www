00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.560
Greetings, my name is Gautam Akiwate and this is

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.200
an abridged version of the ANRP talk

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.360
given at the IETF in London on our paper, "Risky

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.080
Business, Risks Derived from Registrar

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.080
Name Management".

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.010
At a high level, this paper is about how registrars

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.440
created domain hijacking risks as an accidental

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.040
by-product of undocumented operational practices.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.170
We started looking into this issue when in the

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.160
course of our research, we noticed that

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.040
a large number of domains had their name servers

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.560
renamed to a nonsensical name server.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.010
For example, in the case of yourgadgetnews.com,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.640
the name servers ns1 and ns2.noenewbie.com

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.940
transitioned to dropthesourcerandomcharacters.biz.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.090
These drop-the-source name servers were not

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.880
registered.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.640
Thus, a hijacker could register these domains and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.960
become the authoritative name server for

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.600
yourgadgetnews.com.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.490
Not only that, but in our analysis of nine years'

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.880
worth of zone 5, we found that 33%

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.310
of name servers ending in .biz had the substring

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.000
droptheshost in them.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.460
These large numbers indicated that this renaming

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.920
was a result of a systemic issue.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.410
In order to understand how the DNS configuration

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.120
was being modified, we first needed to understand

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.940
how the DNS configuration propagated behind the

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.800
scenes.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.670
Given the large numbers, we quickly zeroed in on

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.600
EPP, the Extensible Provisioning Protocol,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.240
as the root cause.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.770
Next, we built a simplified mental model for EPP

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.640
and then used an example to illustrate

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.110
how EPP constraints lead to name servers being

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.120
renamed.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.790
A good place to start is to think of the top-level

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.600
domain DNS configuration at the registry as

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.600
a database.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.560
This database has two types of objects.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.700
First is the domain object, and the second is the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.800
host object.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.720
Every host object in the same top-level domain

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.840
needs to have a superordinate domain object.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.770
In this case, ns1.foo.com is the subordinate host

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.480
object of foo.com.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.150
No such restrictions exist for host objects

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.960
referencing external top-level domains.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.780
Given that, EPP can then be thought of as the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.400
specification on how this database can

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.400
be modified.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.080
Note that this is a simplification and that there

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.800
is more nuance in EPP, but this simplification

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.200
works for the purposes of this presentation.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.620
Consider this example where we have two domain

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.240
objects, foo.com, registered by registrar

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.750
A, and bar.com, registered by registrar B. Next,

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.360
we introduce the host objects.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.290
Note the subordinate relationships for both foo.com

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.560
and bar.com.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.520
Also note the delegated nameserver relationship.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.570
In this example, ns1.bar.com is not only a subordinate

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.040
host object of bar.com, but also

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.240
its delegated nameserver.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.290
On the other hand, ns2.foo.com is a subordinate

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.060
host object of foo.com, but also the delegated

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.280
nameserver for both foo.com and bar.com.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.630
Note that ns2.foo.com provides nameservice to a

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.200
domain not operated by registrar A, but

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.020
all of this is fine and working as intentioned

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.520
until foo.com expires.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.330
When foo.com expires, registrar A would like to

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.720
purge the domain from the database so that

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.520
it can stop paying the registry for the domain.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.530
However, EPP requires that before deleting the

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.840
domain, it delete the host objects.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.020
So registrar A goes in and deletes ns1.foo.com

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.000
with absolutely no problem.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.340
However, when it tries to delete ns2.foo.com, it

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.960
cannot do so because it is being referenced

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.220
by another domain object, a domain object

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.840
controlled by another registrar, in this case

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.450
registrar B. At this point, registrar A can give

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.480
up and leave the domain in place.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.280
However, to do so means that registrar A keeps

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.760
paying the registry for a domain that it is

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.880
no longer getting paid for.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.210
To prevent this problem, EPP allows for a host

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.000
object to be renamed.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
This is important.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.030
EPP allows ns2.foo.com to be renamed and replaced

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.640
with another name.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.820
So how exactly does this host object renaming

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.280
work?

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.500
There are a few limitations on how host objects

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.640
can be renamed.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.380
The most important limitation is that if renamed

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.120
within the same top level domain, EPP requires

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.160
that the domain object to exist.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.080
Specifically, registrar A cannot rename ns2.foo.com

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.040
to dropthishostrandomcharacters.com if dropthishostrandomcharacters.com

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.040
does not exist.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.350
Note, EPP can enforce this constraint because it

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.120
can check for the existence of the domain

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.160
object in the same top level domain.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.810
However, since EPP cannot check references to

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.200
external top level domains, registrar A

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.460
can rename ns2.foo.com to dropthishostrandomcharacters.biz

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.280
irrespective of whether dropthishostrandomcharacters.biz

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.000
exists or not.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.670
These constraints naturally lead to two choices

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.480
for renaming the host object.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.200
The first is to rename the host object under a

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.200
sync domain owned by registrar A. This guarantees

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.320
the existence of the domain object.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.360
However, now the registrar is on the hook for any

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.520
queries and also the upkeep of the

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.520
sync domain.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.670
In fact, this is a valid concern since the registrar

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.440
that used the sync domain till 2015

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.960
abandoned it, exposing thousands of domains to

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.800
hijack.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.400
The second option is to rename the nameserver to

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.640
a random domain in a different top level

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.640
domain.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.330
The different top level domain bypasses the EPP

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.880
check that random domain prevents impinging

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.680
on existing domains.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.990
Unfortunately, it creates a potential security

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.240
risk.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.070
And in our example, we say that the registrar A

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.960
chooses this second option, the hijackable

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:07.120
renaming, and renames ns2.foo.com to dropthishostrandomcharacters.biz.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.700
Since dropthishostrandomcharacters.biz is no

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.400
longer a subordinate host object of foo.com,

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.250
registrar A can go ahead and delete the domain

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.640
object foo.com, leaving behind the sacrificial

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.550
nameserver dropthishostrandomcharacters.biz,

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.440
which is a lame delegation.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.040
Not only is it a lame delegation, if a hijacker

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.680
were to register this domain, they would be

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.470
able to serve authoritative nameserver queries

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.680
for bar.com.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.780
Essentially, we found that EPP consistency

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.880
constraints led to unintuitive consequences

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.920
on domain deletion.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.230
What makes this particularly insidious is that

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.160
this happens without any action from

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.560
the domain owner or even its own registrar.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.350
There is no intimation that the nameserver has

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.440
been changed.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.630
And what was surprising to us was that even

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.080
domains in restricted top-level domains, such

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.650
as .gov and .edu, were affected, even though they

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.720
did not have any registrars.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.860
If you're interested, please refer to our paper

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.960
for more details.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.710
And now that we understand the how, we would like

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.200
to understand the who.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.320
Who is responsible for creation of these sacrificial

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.480
nameservers?

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.880
And be able to do that longitudinally.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.250
To that end, we leveraged the three properties of

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.760
sacrificial nameservers.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.650
Again, more details as to the specifics of the

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.640
properties are in the paper.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.530
And based on these properties, we could modify

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.440
the methodology we had come up with to identify

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.410
lame delegations, add some constraints to

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.160
identify sacrificial nameservers.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.620
We then applied this methodology on nine years of

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.480
zone files spanning roughly 1,250 top-level

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.740
domains.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.720
We analyzed, again, roughly 20 million nameservers.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.810
And again, more details on the specifics of the

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.400
methodology in the paper.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.970
Using this methodology, we were able to identify

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.380
six registrars that used hijackable renaming

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.440
idioms.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.160
We found that some registrars adopted different

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.600
renaming idioms over the last nine years.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.690
In all, half a million domains were affected as a

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.520
result of this renaming.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.330
Not only were half a million domains exposed, but

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.980
nearly one-third of the domains thus exposed

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.600
were hijacked by actors registering the sacrificial

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.200
nameserver domain.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.430
Hijackers registered drop-the-source randomcharacters.biz

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.960
to hijack all domains using that nameserver.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.960
Again, we have a lot more details in the paper.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.730
And once we had the how and the who, we started

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.000
asking what we could do to remediate the domains.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.130
To that end, we worked with GoDaddy, Enum, and

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.080
Internet.bs to choose a non-hijackable

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.820
renaming idiom.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.600
As a result of our intervention, we have

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.260
prevented roughly 30,000 domains from being

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:54.640
exposed

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.000
in the last year.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.300
Additionally, we also worked with a broader

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.040
registrar community to address currently affected

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.040
domains.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.910
GoDaddy and MarkMonitor were the two registrars

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.040
that made some notable efforts.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.630
However, we know that these are short-term

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.640
solutions, and we need to look for more permanent

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.640
solutions, which invariably means updating EPP.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.580
Again, we have more details as to what these

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.640
options look like in the paper.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.270
In conclusion, we identified nameserver renaming

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.020
practices and the risks thus created.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.310
We quantified the scope and scale of the risks,

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.520
followed by characterizing the abuse of the

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.520
affected domains.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.460
Notably, we led remediation efforts with the

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.720
registrars to prevent creation of new hijackable

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.720
domains and remediate existing affected domains.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.800
And with that, I say thanks.
