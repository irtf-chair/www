%h2 Responsibilities

%p 
  The IRTF is managed by the IRTF Chair in consultation with the Internet
  Research Steering Group (IRSG). The IRTF Chair is appointed by the IAB.
  RFC7827 details the role of the Chair further.

%p 
  The IRTF Chair is responsible for ensuring that Research Groups produce
  coherent, coordinated, architecturally consistent and timely output as a
  contribution to the overall evolution of the Internet architecture. In
  addition to the detailed tasks related to Research Groups outlined below,
  the IRTF Chair may also from time to time arrange for topical workshops
  attended by the IRSG and perhaps other experts in the field.

    encouraging the formation of Research Groups directly, rather than
    waiting for proposals from IRTF participants.

    %b Research Group Coordination
  %dd.col-sm-9
    The IRTF Chair coordinates the work done by the various Research Groups.
  %dt.col-sm-3
    %b Reporting
  %dd.col-sm-9
    The IRTF Chair reports on IRTF progress to the to the IAB and the wider
    Internet community.
  %dt.col-sm-3
    %b Progress Tracking
  %dd.col-sm-9
    The IRTF Chair tracks and manages the progress of the various Research
    Groups with the aid of a regular status report on documents and
    accomplishments from the Research Group Chairs.


%p 
  Anyone interested in creating an IRTF Research Group must submit a
  charter for the proposed group to the IRTF Chair along with a list of
  proposed founding members. The formation of a Research Group requires a
  charter which is initially negotiated between a prospective Research
  Group Chair and the IRTF Chair. When the prospective Chair and the IRTF
  Chair are satisfied with the charter form and content, it becomes the
  basis for forming a Research Group.
