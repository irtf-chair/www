    environment in which people of many different backgrounds are treated

    In cases where the advice from counsel is to restrict an individual
    from using IRTF systems and/or from participating in IRTF meetings, the
    IRTF Chair will follow the principles adopted by the IESG. 
    Due to the potential impact on the standards process, due to shared
    infrastructure and joint meetings between IRTF and IETF, any such
    action by the IRTF Chair will only be taken in consultation with the
    IESG.
