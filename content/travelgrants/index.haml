%p
  The IRTF is pleased to be able to provide a number of Diversity
  Travel Grants, plus a number of 
  %a{:href => "/feewaivers.html"}
    fee waivers,
  to attend research group meetings and workshops. 

%h2 Diversity Travel Grants

%p
  We are pleased to offer a number of Diversity Travel Grants to support
  early-career academics and PhD students from under-represented groups
  to attend the 
  -# %a{ :href => "/anrw/2024/"}
  -#   Applied Networking Research Workshop
  -# and
  IRTF meetings co-located with the
  %a{:href => "https://www.ietf.org/meeting/125/"}
    IETF-125 Meeting
  in Shenzhen, China, in March 2026.

%p
  The selection criteria for IRTF Diversity Grants will prioritize people
  who:
%ul
  %li
    Are from a demographic that is under-represented in the IRTF and would have difficulty getting to
    the IETF meeting otherwise;
  %li
    Are PhD students or early-career academics (PhD students should have completed at least one year
    of full-time study in their PhD programme; early-career academics should normally be within their
    first four years of paid post-PhD employment at a University or other research institute);
  %li
    Can demonstrate engagement with research of relevance to the IRTF (work of relevance to all areas
    of IRTF will be considered, and specific contributions to
    %a{:href => "/groups.html"}
      IRTF Research Groups,
    such as presentations are encouraged).

%p
  Note: IRTF Diversity Grants will be available for repeat meeting
  attendance to encourage connection building and developing
  sustainable engagement with the community. However, it is expected
  that applicants use them to develop connections that help them find
  independent funding resources, hence IRTF Diversity Grant funding
  will be prioritized for candidates who have received no more than
  two (in exceptional cases three) grants before.

%p
  %b Interested applicants should fill out the
  %a{:href => "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTylJ4d-Ra9SQLvW3ws_iIzCCKo4WfTePJkCRIA2f91-g7zg/viewform"}
    IRTF Travel Grant Application form.

%p
  Please contact us as
  %a{:href => "mailto:travel-grants@irtf.org"}
    travel-grants@irtf.org
  if you have any problems accessing the form.
  
%p
  If the applicant is a PhD student, 
  %b their adviser must also send a letter of support to
  %a{:href => "mailto:travel-grants@irtf.org"}
    travel-grants@irtf.org
  verifying the applicant’s good standing in the institution, and
  confirming that they have completed at least one year of full-time
  (or equivalent part-time) PhD study.

  %b Support for remote attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic:
  The focus of the diversity travel grants is on in-person attendance at
  IRTF meetings co-located with the IETF since we believe this offers the
  best opportunity to connect with the community. 
  We recognise that the COVID-19 pandemic is still causing difficultiess
  with travel for many, however, and so will also consider applications to
  offset reasonable costs incurred to support remote attendance (e.g.,
  childcare, travel to a local meeting hub, etc.) where such would
  encourage diversity of participation. Such applications should be
  submitted following the process for diversity travel grants outlined
  above. We are grateful to Comcast for this support.

%p
  Fee waivers for remote attendance are available under a 
  %a{ :href => "https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/125/" } separate programme
  and are not covered by these diversity grants.
