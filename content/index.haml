      The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) promotes research of importance
      to the evolution of the Internet protocols, applications, architecture
      and technology.

    %h2 Overview

    %p
      The
      %span.term Internet Research Task Force
      (IRTF) focuses on longer term research issues related to the Internet
      while the parallel organization, the
      %span.term Internet Engineering Task Force
      (IETF), focuses on the shorter term issues of engineering and
      standards making.

    %p
      The IRTF is comprised of a number of focused and long-term
      %a{:href => "/groups.html"}
        Research Groups.
      These groups work on topics related to Internet protocols,
      applications, architecture and technology. Research Groups have the
      stable long-term membership needed to promote the development of
      research collaboration and teamwork in exploring research issues.
      Participation is by individual contributors, rather than by
      representatives of organizations.

    %p
      The IRTF also organises the 
      %a{ :href => "/anrw/"} ACM/IRTF Applied Networking Research Workshop
      and the
      %a{ :href => "/anrp/"} Applied Networking Research Prize
      to encourage collaboration between the academic research world and
      the Internet standards community.

    %p
      The IRTF also makes available a number of 
      %a{ :href => "/travelgrants/"} travel grants
      and
      %a{ :href => "/feewaivers.html"} fee waivers
      to support PhD students, early career researchers, and
      under-represented groups to attend research group meeting,
      workshops, and other IRTF-related events. 

    %h2 Research Groups

    %p These #{$rgs.count} Research Groups are currently chartered or proposed for chartering:

    %h2.mt-3 More Information

    %p
      RFC7418 gives an IRTF Primer for IETF Participants. It provides a
      high-level description of issues for IETF participants to consider
      when bringing proposals for new research groups into the IRTF, and
      emphasizes differences in expectations between the two organizations.

    %p
      The IRTF is managed by the
      %a{:href => "/chair.html"}
        IRTF Chair
      in consultation with the
      %a{:href => "/irsg.html"}
        Internet Research Steering Group
      (IRSG). The IRSG membership includes the IRTF Chair, the chairs of
      the various Research Groups, and other individuals ("members at
      large") from the research community selected by the IRTF Chair.

    %p
      The governance and operation of the IRTF is described by various
      %a{:href => "/policies" }
        RFCs and other policy documents
      including 
      %a{:href => "/policies/ipr.html" }
        Intellectual Property Rights disclosure rules.
      The IETF's
      %a{:href => "https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-anti-harassment-policy/"}
        Anti-Harassment Policy
      and
      %a{:href => "https://ietf.org/privacy-statement/"}
        Privacy Policy
      also apply to the IRTF.

    %p
      The
      %a{:href => "/mailman/listinfo/irtf-announce"} irtf-announce@irtf.org
      mailing list is a low-volume announcement mailing list for Research
      Group creations and conclusions, IRTF RFC publication, etc.

    %p
      The
      %a{:href => "/mailman/listinfo/irtf-discuss"} irtf-discuss@irtf.org
      mailing list is the main discussion list for general IRTF topics.
