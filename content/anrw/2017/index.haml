      The ACM, IRTF &amp; ISOC Applied Networking Research Workshop 2017
      (#{@item[:menu]}) provides a forum for researchers, vendors, network operators
      and the Internet standards community to present and discuss emerging results
      in applied networking research.

    %p
      Researchers should consider submitting
      early emerging results that illustrate the scientific and engineering
      principles underlying the Internet architecture, protocols and applications;
      that demonstrate new capabilities, features, or extensions to the Internet
      protocol layers; that enhance our understanding of how Internet protocols work
      in real-world deployments or realistic testbeds; or that improve Internet
      security and privacy, scalability, performance, and robustness.
