      The ACM, IRTF &amp; ISOC Applied Networking Research Workshop 2018
      (ANRW’18) is an academic workshop that provides a forum for researchers,
      vendors, network operators, and the Internet standards community to
      present and discuss emerging results in applied networking research. Our
      other goal is to create a path for <strong>academics to transition
      research back into the IETF standards and protocols</strong> and for
      academics to find inspiration from topics and open problems addressed at
      the IETF.

    %p
      <strong>We are particularly interested in topics that focus on wide-area networks and network security</strong>, but applied networking topics outside of these focus areas are also welcome.
