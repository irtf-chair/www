00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.770
Hello everyone, this is Romain Fonthune from IAJ

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.520
Research Lab, and today I will present

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.400
our latest results on BGP zombies.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.900
So first let me explain what a BGP zombie is.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.990
So this figure represents how one prefix is seen

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.400
by RIS routers.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.600
On the y-axis here you have all the RIS routers,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.880
and on the x-axis you have time.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.630
The prefix we are looking at is one of the RIS BGP

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.420
beacon prefixes, and the green circles

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.100
here show that the prefix is announced by one of

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.720
the routers.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.030
Then the green line shows that the prefix is

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.920
active in the router routing table, and

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.670
the red cross shows that the prefix is withdrawn

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.080
by the router.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.410
So here it means the prefix is active for two

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.540
hours, then it's withdrawn for two hours,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.840
and then it's announced again for two hours, and

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.880
withdrawn again, and announced again,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.000
and this is what we expect from BGP beacons.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.030
But you can see that there are three lines here

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.640
that represent three routers that think

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.000
that this prefix is active during this time, even

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.080
though we know that the prefix was withdrawn

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.400
by RIV.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.220
And this is what we call a BGP zombie, so here we

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.200
have three zombies.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.920
In summary, a BGP zombie is an active entry in a

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.400
routing table that corresponds to a prefix

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.560
that is in fact withdrawn by its originators.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.070
So in the past we've looked at these BGP zombies,

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.280
and we used BGP beacons to do that.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.070
That was a work we published in PAL in 2019, but

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.960
it didn't really tell us anything about

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.200
the regular prefixes we're using on the internet.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.370
And this is the goal we set for this work here,

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.240
we want to monitor BGP zombies for regular

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.430
prefixes and see if it's as bad as what we've

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.500
seen for beacons.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.200
So for beacons, finding zombies was very easy

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.600
because we knew already when the prefix is

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.800
withdrawn and when it's announced again.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.000
But here, because we are looking at any prefix on

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.560
the internet, we have to find out when

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.120
an originator is going to withdraw a prefix.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.190
And to do that, we are looking at a metric, which

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.480
is the number of active routers for

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.600
a prefix.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.520
It's shown here in that figure, so that metric

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.440
ranges between 0 and 1.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.450
One means that all the routers we are using see

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.720
that prefix as active.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.040
So it might decrease a bit, and there's some

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.480
noise in this metric, which means that some

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.280
routers might withdraw the prefix, there is some

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.480
topological change that can happen on

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.960
the internet that could cause this noise.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.750
But when we see a significant drop, and it's when

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.080
things start to get interesting, is it

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.040
when the drop will go down to zero.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.960
In this case, it means that all the routers we

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.920
are using, they all withdraw the prefix.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.220
If it goes down and then up again, and then

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.760
stabilizes, that means there was some significant

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.780
change in the topology.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.730
So maybe that prefix was withdrawn and then re-announced

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.520
by the same origin or a different

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.480
origin.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.010
But what is interesting for us is to see when

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.840
there is a significant change, a significant

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.910
drop, and then this metric, the number of active

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.160
routers, is stable but at a low value.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.060
Here it means that only a few routers didn't

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.020
withdraw that prefix.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.220
And if it lasts for a certain time, then we're

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.000
going to say that this is a BGP zombie.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.320
So this is our definition of the BGP zombie.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.460
When we see the majority of the routers have

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.720
withdrawn the prefix, we're going to wait

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.720
90 minutes.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.330
And after 90 minutes, if we see that the prefix

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.880
was not completely withdrawn, or it wasn't

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.320
re-announced, then we're going to say this is a

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.960
zombie.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.100
You can check the paper for some of the details

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.160
why we use 90 minutes.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.560
We have some explanation for that in the paper.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.480
I don't have time to explain it.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.900
So using this very simple zombie detector, we

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.880
analyzed six years of BGP data and found

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.520
6.5 million of BGP zombies.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.420
And we looked at different things in these

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.600
zombies.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.520
First we ran some sanity checks.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.920
I will explain in the next slide.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.570
And we also looked at some of the characteristics

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.960
of zombies in the wild.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.480
One of the first sanity checks we've done is to

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.840
look at what we call the state covariance

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.560
between risk-peers.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.040
So here's an example of a zombie that appears in

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.960
AS3.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.200
So AS3 is reporting a pass to a certain prefix.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.400
This pass is AS3, AS2, AS1, and AS0.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.000
So AS3 tells us that it can reach that prefix

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.440
through these ASes.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.330
But we have access to one of these ASes through

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.080
risk.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.780
And that AS tells us that it has withdrawn this

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.760
prefix.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.410
So because those two information are conflicting,

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.560
we see that the states here are incorrect.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.540
One of the risk-peers tells us that it has a pass

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.880
to a prefix.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.000
But on this pass, we see that one of the ASes has

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.400
actually withdrawn the prefix.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.250
After this, Willy tells us that there is in fact

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.320
a zombie.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.920
And it's not a misclassification.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.440
So we use that to validate our result.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.560
But to do that, we have to have a zombie pass

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.960
with at least two risk-peers in the AS pass.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:25.720
So about 68% of the zombie pass detected have two

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.920
risk-peers.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.360
And for this 68% of pass, we found that almost 95%

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.800
of them have incorrect states.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.360
So that means they are really zombies.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.050
And the rest are not really conclusive because it

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.360
could be that the two risk-peers we have

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.600
access to, both are affected by the zombie.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.080
So we cannot really say if it's a misclassification

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.960
or not.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.410
Another thing we looked at is where are the beacons

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.640
in our result.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.050
And we found that the risk-BGP beacons account

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.800
for 3.2% of all the zombies we detected.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.990
3.2% seems to be a small value, but actually it's

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.360
very big because there is only 27 risk-beacon

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.210
prefixes out of the 800,000 prefixes we have on

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.880
the internet.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.460
So only those few prefixes have created a lot of

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.440
zombies.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.810
And one of the questions we had then was, okay,

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.360
maybe noisier prefixes like risk-BGP

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.000
beacons are more prone to zombies.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And this is what we looked at in this figure.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.010
We took the prefixes that had a lot of zombies

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.880
and we looked at the number of updates for

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.480
these prefixes.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.940
You can see that as the number of updates is

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.440
increasing, the chance to have zombies

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.120
is also increasing.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.550
One takeaway from this is that beacons are not

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.640
really representative of what we observe

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.920
for the regular prefixes.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.200
This was especially true for IPv4.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.350
And we also looked at zombies for popular content

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.240
networks.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.870
So we took 42 ASN that are commonly found in the

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.160
top 15 Alexa, Umbrella, and Majestic

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.440
lists, and we looked at how many zombies they had.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.100
Here's the ranking of this ASN over time, and you

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.840
can see that some of them had zombies

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.160
almost every month.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.160
We did this only for two years in 2018 and 2019.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.920
And we looked a bit more at this ASN.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.790
We looked at a different characteristic, and what

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.960
we found was that the top ASN popular

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:58.190
content networks usually have also either denounced

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:02.760
a lot of prefixes or they have very

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.800
long ASN passlines.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.080
And if we think about it, it kind of makes sense.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.880
If we assume that BGP zombies are due to bugs in

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.320
routers, then a longer passline means that

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.450
it's going to imply more routers and thus more

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.320
chance to hit one of these bugs.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.770
And finally in the paper, we looked at some of

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.720
the side effects of BGP zombies.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:39.400
We found that 77,000 zombies created the tools.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.830
For example, it would be cases where the pass

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.480
would follow backup links instead of the usual

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.280
AS pass we'd see.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.790
And we also found that some zombies have an

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.520
origin that is different than its covering

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:03.260
prefix because that route is stuck, then we might

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.960
have a wrong origin as information.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.790
I won't give the detail here, but you can look at

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:09.360
the paper.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.760
In some cases, the BGP zombies can create routing

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.160
loops, and we found over 400 of potential

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.520
routing loops in our result.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.760
I also advise you to look at this presentation

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.360
from PLNOT last year, where they give a concrete

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:31.280
example of routing loops and also the truss route

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.920
to show that.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.480
Okay, so that concludes my presentation.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.930
In this work, we look at BGP zombies for regular

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:40.960
prefixes.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.560
We found that zombies are widely spread.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:48.900
We found zombies for very popular content

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.480
networks.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.530
Even though it's widely spread, it's not as bad

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.080
as what our past study using BGP beacon

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.080
was suggesting.
