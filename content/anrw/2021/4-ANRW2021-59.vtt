00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.170
Hi everyone, my name is Niemann Bauer. I'm a

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.440
research associate at the Technical University of

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.000
Munich

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.280
here at the Chair of Network Architectures and

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.000
Services.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.880
And today I want to talk about our work on the

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.000
evolution of Internet flow characteristics.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.380
As we all know, there's ongoing change on the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.000
Internet regarding new technologies

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.740
adapting user behavior or changing Internet

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.000
services.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We are all aware of improving network expansions.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.030
We all observed the smartphone boom during the

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.000
last decade.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We are aware of the Internet of Things that rises

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.500
and of course we know about audio and video

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.000
streaming services.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
At the same time, previous studies present methodologies

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to survey flow characteristics

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
like flow duration, flow size or flow rates.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.300
But recent insights into flow characteristics in

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.000
the Internet are rare.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And therefore our paper pursues the question

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.930
how flow characteristics changed during the last

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.000
few years.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.200
To answer such question, our paper surveys the

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.280
distribution and correlation of flow

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.000
characteristics

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.030
and applies different taxonomies to assess the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.000
relevance of heavy hitter flows

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.890
in the sense of elephant flows but also in the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.000
sense of so-called big fast flows.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.190
Before we start talking about our methodology and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.000
our measurement results

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.720
let me briefly introduce a scalable flow analysis

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.000
tool implemented in Go

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.370
that provides large scalability due to parallelized

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.000
packet parsing and flow aggregation.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.110
The tool is published as free and open source

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.000
with our paper.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.350
The tool consists of five major components which

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.000
are illustrated on the right.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.300
The first component is a reader that reads

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.000
packets from a PCAP file.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.070
We have multiple parsers that extract packet

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.000
features from such read packets.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.410
Those packet features are then written into a

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.380
ring buffer component that is proposed to reorder

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.000
packets.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.100
A regular routine then writes such reordered

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.000
packet information into pools

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.880
where we collect package features per flow until

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.000
a flow terminates.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.190
After its termination, flow data is written to

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.000
the metric component

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
where we then calculate our flow characteristics.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Let's talk about flows.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.480
We identify flows based on the IP5 tuple as we

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.000
will focus on TCP traffic for our study.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.700
We identify the start of TCP flows with a three-way

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.000
handshake.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.170
We terminate a TCP flow when we observe a

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.000
connection teardown.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.350
If there is an idle period of a flow for a

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.000
certain timeout period

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
we observe a freshly established three-way handshake

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
of an IP5 tuple that is already tracked.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
For identified flows, we calculate the flow size

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
in the sense of the sum of layer 4 payload sizes.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.320
We calculate flow duration as the time interval

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.000
between the first and the last packet we observe.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.740
We calculate flow rate as the average data rate

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.000
based on flow size and flow duration.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.390
For our study, we compose a dataset consisting of

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.000
28 traces provided by KIDR.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.340
Such traces have anonymized IP addresses and no

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.000
layer 4 payloads.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.420
Each trace provides one hour of traffic that is

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.430
captured at a 10 gigabit per second ISP backbone

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.000
link.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.790
As illustrated below on the timeline, we select

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.000
23 traces taken in Chicago between 2008 and 2016

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.770
and 5 traces taken in New York between 2018 and

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.000
2020.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.280
As you see, we have three periods without traces

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.000
for several months.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.760
On average, we select traces in an interval of

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.000
three months.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.270
But there are three larger intervals without

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.160
traces because there are simply no traces

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.000
available.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Regarding pre-processing of such traffic,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.350
we only consider TCP flows that are longer than

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.000
or equal to 100 milliseconds.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.080
This is also done by related work and proposed to

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.000
filter out quite short flows

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.230
because calculated flow rates are falsified for

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.320
short flows in case of single packet flows or if

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.000
all packets are sent back-to-back.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Let's talk about selected measurement results.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Regarding the evolution of heavy hitters,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.330
related work proposes a definition of heavy hitter

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.000
traffic based on the 99th percentile of a

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.000
characteristic.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.560
The 99th percentile of flow duration, flow size,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.000
and flow rate.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.100
We analyzed the evolution of such 99th percentiles

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.000
over time.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
As you can see plotted here on the right, let me

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.000
point out two major findings.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.190
Regarding the 99th percentile of flow duration,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.000
here on top of the plot,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.770
we observe that there is only little increase

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.000
during the years 2008 until 2013.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.240
But afterwards, we observe an increase by factor

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.000
1.5 between June 2013 and March 2016.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.410
A further major finding of that analysis is the

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.000
increase of the 99th percentile of flow rates,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
which refers to the bottom plot here.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.450
Here we observe a clear trend towards larger flow

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.000
rates in the 99th percentile,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.620
i.e. an increase from around 400 kbps up to 800 kbps

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.000
in 2015.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.630
Next, we were interested in the relevance of such

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.000
heavy hitter traffic.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.550
Therefore, we calculated the share of transmitted

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.020
bytes by such flows within the 99th percentile

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.000
for each flow characteristic.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.210
We did not find a specific trend over time, so

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.840
here the table shows the average across all

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.000
traces taken in Chicago.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.640
In the second column, in the right column, we see

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.080
the share of bytes transmitted by different

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.000
percentiles.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.490
Especially the flows within the 99th percentile

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.710
of flow size represent a large share of totally

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.000
transmitted bytes

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.600
with nearly 90% of all TCP bytes transmitted by

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.000
such 1% of flows.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.620
Further, we had a look at so-called big fast

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.000
flows.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.070
Zhang et al. introduced a 2-2 taxonomy based on

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:39.990
two threshold values to group flows regarding

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.000
their size and their flow rate.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
We had a closer look at the relevance of such big

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.880
fast flows, which are represented by only a small

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.000
share of flows,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.090
but as we will see, have a large relevance

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:59.000
regarding the share of bytes that they transmit.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
We defined three threshold pairs.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.760
The first pair refers to the original threshold

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.690
values from Zhang et al., i.e. 100 kbps regarding

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.000
size and 10 kbps for flow rate.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.470
Then we increased the thresholds by one magnitude

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.000
for pair 2 and pair 3.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.860
Let me highlight the increase of the share of

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.050
bytes transmitted by the second threshold pair

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.000
illustrated in green.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.470
Here we observe an increase of bytes transmitted

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:40.120
by big fast flows between 20 and 30% for traces

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.000
in 2018 until 2010,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.950
up to between 40 and 50% of all bytes transmitted

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.000
by TCP.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.480
For more recent traces taken in Chicago, the

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.000
values for the New York dataset are smaller,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.450
which can be traced back to a larger share of

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:04.000
small flows for such traces.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.550
To conclude my talk, let me summarize our

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.000
findings.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.650
As we have seen here in the talk, we observe a

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.510
significant increase of the 99th percentile of

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.000
flow duration and rate.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.590
We find a large significance of heavy hitters

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.000
regarding the share of transmitted bytes.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.440
We observe an increase regarding the relevance of

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.000
big fast flows during the past years.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.610
Further, and not included in the talk, but in our

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.220
paper, you will find an analysis of the

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.000
distribution of flow characteristics over time

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.870
and a study of correlation coefficients between

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.000
the flow characteristics,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
where we can confirm findings of previous studies,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.730
especially regarding a strong positive

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.000
correlation between flow rate and flow size.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.590
That's it from my side. Now I'm happy and looking

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:02.000
forward to answer your questions.
