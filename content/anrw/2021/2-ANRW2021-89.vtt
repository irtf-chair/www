00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.120
Hi everyone, my name is Basi and I'll present our

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.320
work on institutional privacy risks in

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.320
sharing DNS data.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.790
This is a joint work with my PhD advisors,

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.600
Professor Aleksandr Korolova and Professor

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.600
John Heidemann.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.120
Almost all online activities such as accessing a

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.080
website or sending an email start with a

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.080
DNS query.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.980
Therefore, DNS queries can say a lot about end

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.640
users' online activities and this privacy

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.750
risk has been well understood and studied in the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.520
past.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.330
In our work, we introduce a new aspect of DNS

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.520
privacy which we call institutional privacy,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.650
which is concerned with the behavior of an

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.560
institution's traffic as a whole.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.870
In contrast to individual privacy, this has not

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.800
been closely studied before, but it's

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.260
important to look at because an institution's

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.980
internal activities such as sending or receiving

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.130
an email can leave a digital trail in the DNS

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.320
ecosystem.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.910
Based on this motivation, our contributions in

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.360
this work are first to define institutional

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.460
privacy as a new privacy risk in DNS.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.940
And within this threat model that we define, we

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.320
give a methodology for finding institutional

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.610
privacy leaks and then we apply this methodology

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.080
to real-world data that's anonymized and show

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.510
the privacy risks and also demonstrate that the

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.560
anonymization method that's used is not

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.320
sufficient to prevent institutional leaks.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.890
To start off with how we define institutional

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.880
privacy, we broadly define it as confidentiality

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.820
of digital footprints of an institution's

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.600
internal activities.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.520
Examples of specific activities that may leak

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.040
information through DNS include, for example,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.950
two institutions sending or receiving an email

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.360
between each other which may reveal a

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.160
relationship

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.520
between them that's not known publicly.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.460
Or another activity is an employee of a company

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.520
accessing a privacy-sensitive website that's

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.720
considered embarrassing from the company's peer

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.000
perspective, such as an illegal or an

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.820
adult website and accessing such websites while

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.680
on the company's network.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.260
For our threat model, we consider an adversary

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.640
that's at the authoritative server and has

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.570
either access to the server logs or the traffic

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.880
between the recursive and authoritative server.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.580
And the goal of the adversary is to associate the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.020
source IP and the domain name in the query

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.080
to the corresponding institution.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.540
The adversary targets an institution that meets

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.520
two kinds of conditions.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.650
The first one is the institution must run its own

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.200
recursive resolver.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.590
This would let the adversary use the resolver's

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.080
IP address to uniquely identify the DNS traffic

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.320
of the institution.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.920
And the second condition is the institution must

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.800
route traffic from its own autonomous

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.000
system.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.770
And this would let the adversary map the resolver's

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.160
IP address to the corresponding autonomous

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.280
system that's owned by the institution.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.650
Many institutions' adversaries fit our threat

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.160
model.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.900
In our study, we studied queries from six

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.720
institutions that meet the conditions that

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.340
I just listed and also represent a diverse set of

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.160
sectors such as largest MP500 companies,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.040
government institutions, University of Southern

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.960
California schools, and so on.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.430
And when we pick these companies, we exclude

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.040
institutions that have apparent deniability

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.560
such as ISPs or hosting service providers because

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.880
queries from these companies might

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.330
be coming from their customers and not from their

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.480
employees.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.770
And examples of potential real-world adversaries

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.120
in our threat model include DNS service providers,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.810
and also researchers that have access to data

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.240
that's shared by the service providers for

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.240
research purposes, and also government-level

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.840
actors that have the means to eavesdrop on

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.840
DNS traffic.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.950
In this talk for our methodology, I focus on how

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.080
we associate queries with an institution

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.830
and how we find queries related to email, but

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.720
there is more in the paper.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.110
As I mentioned earlier, the goal of the adversary

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.080
is to associate the source IP and the domain

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.280
name with an institution.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.370
So, for the source IP, we use public IP to AS

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.640
number mapping data to map the source IP

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.160
to the institution that owns the AS.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.830
And this works even if partial preserving anonymization

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.680
method is used.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.960
And second, for the domain name, we use a public

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.360
Whois data to map the domain name to

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.140
the institution that owns the domain.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.920
Here we assume the domain is in full and that QNAME

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.440
minimization is not being used.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.340
Once we identify queries related to an

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.790
institution, we filter and find queries that are

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.480
related

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.440
to email exchange.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.250
The first one is MX queries, which are made by

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.760
mail servers before sending an email.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.930
And in this case, the source IP of the query

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.800
identifies the sender of the email and the

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.650
domain name in the query identifies the intended

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.800
recipient.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.940
And the second type of query we look at is DNSBL

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.560
queries, which are made by anti-spam

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.400
services upon receiving an email.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.180
In this case, the source IP identifies the

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.920
recipient of the email and the IP address

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.930
that's embedded within the domain name identifies

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.320
the sender of the email.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.310
We apply this methodology to one week of B-Root

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.080
data and we also reproduce our results on

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.080
a second week.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.120
This data set is anonymized using a prefix

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.840
preserving method.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.840
The bottom eight bits are anonymized.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.720
And we run this experiment with IRB approval and

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.840
with the permission of the data owners.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.040
And the research questions that we looked at are

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.760
first, how common are sensitive email

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.560
related queries?

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.610
And then within these queries, are we able to

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.160
find specific relationships between institutions

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.200
that's not otherwise publicly known?

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.800
In the paper, we also look at how common are

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.520
queries to sensitive sites, which I won't

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.800
cover in this talk.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.780
So first we looked at how common are MX and DNSBL

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.280
queries in the data set that we looked

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.280
at.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.560
This plot shows the x-axis is the seven days of

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.440
data that we looked at and the y-axis is

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.600
the number of queries in millions.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.080
And we can see that several millions of DNSBL and

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.080
MX queries are made each day, which can

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.080
be a significant source of leakage of email

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.480
related traffic.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.100
And within this millions of queries, we can go

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.360
further and ask, are we able to narrow

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.030
down and look for specific relationships between

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.400
institutions?

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.020
And in this slide, the plot on the left shows a

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.880
breakdown of those MX queries by the different

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.600
sectors of companies that we studied and the plot

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.560
on the right narrows down even further

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.900
and looks at queries made to specific

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.120
institutions such as Palantir.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.680
And we mentioned some examples of specific

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.520
relationships that we find.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.200
For example, US Department of Justice IP address

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.480
requesting MX record of Palantir.com, which

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.740
is in line with the known fact that Palantir

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.280
works with government agencies.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.010
And another example is a school board in

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.470
Jefferson Parish requesting MX record of ICE,

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:15.840
which

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.080
is also in line with the known fact that this

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.080
parish is known to work with ICE in their

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.720
deportation efforts.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.510
We show these examples just based on one week of

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.480
data, but we expect a more dedicated adversary

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.700
that can look at a longer duration of traffic to

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.480
find even more institutional privacy violations.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.230
So based on these results, our recommendations

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.500
are for institutions to deploy query name

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.440
minimization wherever possible.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.570
So we recommend an even faster adoption of this

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.200
mechanism.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.700
Another option is to use a mechanism called local

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.440
routes, which caches the route zone

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.390
locally so that the recursive resolver does not

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:12.440
have to make queries to the route server.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.530
And for service providers, our recommendations

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.840
are first we have shown that host-only anonymization

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.900
is not sufficient for protecting institutional

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.200
privacy.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.780
So we recommend service providers to put legal

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.040
constraints when sharing DNS data and for

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.830
the case of wider sharing where that's not

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.600
possible, that they look into more rigorous

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.200
privacy preserving data sharing approaches.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.820
In this work, we have shown that DNS queries may

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.480
leak significant institutional information

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.920
that's otherwise not publicly known.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.310
Therefore, we recommend institutions deploy query

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.800
name minimization wherever possible

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.970
and that service providers evaluate institutional

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.920
privacy risks when sharing DNS data for research

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.920
purposes.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.160
With that, I conclude my talk.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.600
Thank you for listening.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.930

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.080
